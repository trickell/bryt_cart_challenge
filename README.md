# Bryt Designs Tech Challenge

### Tradeoffs and what I would have done better

First off, thanks for the challenge. I've learned a ton of things about shopify and graphQL that will definitely be implementing the future on my recent projects. 

To start off I had to tradeoff my styling by a lot. I'm using basic tailwind styling in my opinion to get something less exciting. I also wanted to create and work on a .svg animated background which I had to trade off to get functionality working for variants. 

Other things I would have definitely implemented if the time was there. I would have implemented validation and checks when the user removes an item to the cart. There would have been popups confirming the deletion. I would have also added visual cues when something gets added successfully pointing the cart and had the cart implemented better (as a side bar slideout), with better visualization of it. There would also be automated showing of the cart when the user adds a product.

One of the biggest things I wish I could have got around to implementing is pagination for the products and a filter allowing the user to select how many products they can see on screen (10,20,30). I also considered using React Suspend instead of pagination to lazy load the products in as the user scrolled. I prefer pagination most the time when it comes to viewing products.

I would have also created a top filter for the products allowing the user to filter through products by type and price and would have also given a sort option to sort products by most recently added, name, or price. 

These are the things I would have done differently if I had more time with the shop. Sincerely, thanks again for the challenge and all the stuff I've learned (GraphQL) while creating this project.

### Shopify Quick View Modal (Headless UI Feature)

### Hello fellow candidate! 👋

Thanks for taking the time to work through this Bryt Designs challenge — we’re excited to see what you build! 😄

Today’s challenge is to build a **single, high-fidelity storefront feature** using **Next.js (React)**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **Motion**, and Shopify’s **Storefront GraphQL API**.

This is intentionally **design- and animation-forward**. We care a lot about visual polish, interaction details, and thoughtful UI states—while still seeing how you model React state and integrate real Shopify data.

---

## Why a Quick View Modal?

A Quick View modal is one of the best “small but deep” features in modern commerce UI:

- It requires real product/variant data modeling (Storefront API + GraphQL)
- It forces careful component design (layout, hierarchy, accessibility)
- It reveals attention to detail via states (loading, disabled, success)
- It’s an ideal place to demonstrate tasteful animation via Motion

---

## What’s the goal of this challenge? ⚽

We want to understand your abilities by measuring:

- **Design quality** (layout, spacing, typography, responsiveness)
- **Animation quality** (Motion transitions, microinteractions, cohesion)
- **React problem-solving** (state modeling, derived state, UI correctness)
- **Shopify knowledge** (Storefront API queries, product/variant logic)
- **Code clarity** (TypeScript usage, structure, readability)

---

## What’s the process like?

- You will have **6 hours** from when you receive this challenge to complete and submit your project.
- Please complete it to the best of your ability within the time you choose.
- Submit your repo via email when finished.
- Include notes in your README about tradeoffs and what you’d do next with more time.

We’re not expecting a full storefront—**just one polished feature**.

# Project Requirements

### Required tools

1. **Node (LTS)**
2. **PNPM** (we use this as our only Node package manager)
3. A Shopify store we provide access to (Storefront token + collection handle)
   - We will provide:
     - `SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_PRIVATE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_NAME`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_VERSION`

### Required technologies (must be used)

- Next.js (React)
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Motion
- Shopify Storefront GraphQL API

**Please feel free to use other libraries if needed, but try to keep usage minimal. You may use a Headless component library, however, you will be disqualified if you use any ui component library (Material UI, Shadcn, ...etc).**

## Challenge Goals

### Required (Must Have)

- [ ] Fetch and render a minimal product listing from the provided Shopify **collection handle** (Storefront API).
- [ ] Each product card includes at least: image, title, price, and a **Quick View** trigger.
- [ ] Clicking **Quick View** opens a **modal** (not a drawer).
- [ ] Modal can be closed via:
  - [ ] Close button
  - [ ] Backdrop click
  - [ ] `Escape` key
- [ ] Background scroll is locked while the modal is open.
- [ ] Basic focus management:
  - [ ] Focus moves into the modal on open
  - [ ] Focus returns to the triggering element on close
- [ ] Product details shown inside the modal are fetched from Shopify’s **Storefront API** (GraphQL).
- [ ] Modal includes a designed **loading skeleton state** while product details are loading.
- [ ] Modal layout:
  - [ ] Desktop: two-column layout (media left, content right)
  - [ ] Mobile: stacked layout (media top, content bottom)
- [ ] Variant selection UI:
  - [ ] Render product options (e.g., Size/Color) as designed controls (pills/segmented preferred)
  - [ ] Maintain `selectedOptions` state (option-name → value)
  - [ ] Resolve the selected variant from `selectedOptions`
  - [ ] Disable unavailable/invalid option values based on current partial selection
  - [ ] Update displayed **price** when the resolved variant changes
  - [ ] Update displayed **image** when the resolved variant changes (variant image preferred; fallback allowed)
- [ ] Primary CTA: **Add to bag (simulation only)**:
  - [ ] CTA disabled until a valid, available variant is selected
  - [ ] On click, simulate async add with a deterministic delay (~800–1200ms)
  - [ ] CTA transitions to a success state (e.g., “Added” + check)
  - [ ] After ~1–2 seconds, reset to idle **or** close the modal (choose one and be consistent)
- [ ] **Motion** requirements:
  - [ ] Backdrop fade in/out
  - [ ] Modal entrance/exit animation
  - [ ] At least one microinteraction animation (examples below are acceptable):
    - [ ] Animated selected option indicator
    - [ ] Button loading → success transition
    - [ ] Image crossfade when variant changes
    - [ ] Subtle press feedback on CTA
- [ ] TypeScript requirements:
  - [ ] No `any` for the core Shopify response shapes used in the modal (product, variants, options, prices)

---

### Optional (Nice to Have / Extra Credit)

- [ ] Shared element transition: product card image → modal hero image.
- [ ] Prefetch product detail data on product hover/focus to reduce perceived modal load time.
- [ ] Route-based modal:
  - [ ] Opening Quick View updates the URL (e.g., `/products/[handle]`)
  - [ ] Closing returns to the previous route without a full page reload
- [ ] Focus trap + full accessible modal semantics (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, labelled title).
- [ ] Sticky mobile CTA bar (improves usability on small screens).
- [ ] Keyboard enhancements:
  - [ ] Arrow-key navigation through option values
  - [ ] Enter/Space activation on option controls
- [ ] Refined state handling:
  - [ ] Abort/cancel in-flight product fetch on rapid modal switching
  - [ ] Avoid UI flicker when switching products (keep previous content until new content is ready)
- [ ] UI polish extras:
  - [ ] Thumbnail gallery with animated selection states
  - [ ] Price/compare-at layout transitions using Motion layout animations
  - [ ] Reduced motion support (`prefers-reduced-motion`)
